There are two databases in this project: one for real-looking dev data, and another for simpler test data.

You will need to create two .env files in the project directory: .env.test and .env.development. Into each, add PGDATABASE=, with the correct database name for that environment (see /db/setup.sql for the database names). 

Double check that these .env files are .gitignored.
